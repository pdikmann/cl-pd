# CL-PD

Common Lisp helpers for generating PureData patches. WIP!

# Usage

`main.lisp` is not the main file. `usage.lisp` is. Will fix that later.

# Roadmap

- add the missing node types: messages, comments, floatatoms, symbolatoms, subpatches, ...
- add superspecial nodes like sliders (hsl, vsl), bangs etc. pp. that have dozens of parameters
- add option to position nodes by hand (:x :y keywords)
- add auto-layouter (look at graphviz for inspiration)
